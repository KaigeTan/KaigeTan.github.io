I received my B.Eng. in Mechatronics Engineering from the School of Mechatronics Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT), Harbin, China, in 2018, and my M.Sc. in Mechatronics from the Department of Machine Design, Royal Institute of Technology (KTH), Stockholm, Sweden, in 2019, through 3+2 program.

During September 2019 - October 2020, I worked as a model-in-the-loop engineer in ETAS, Robert Bosch GmbH, Shanghai, China.

Since December 2020, I am working towards my Ph.D. degree in the Unit of Mechatronics and Embedded Control Systems, KTH, under spervision of Prof. Lei Feng.

My research insterests include convex optimization, reinforcement learning, and optimal filtering.
